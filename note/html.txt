        + internal:
            - using <style> element in the <head> section
            - used to define a style for a single HTML page.
        + external:
            - using <link>  element to link to an external CSS file
            - used to define the style for many HTML pages.

        + alwyas take up the full width available
        + 2 common used: <p>, <div>

        + there are a lot of block-level elements in HTML
    - inline element:

        + <span> element
        + there are a lot of inline elements in HTML
    - the <div> element:
        + often used as a container for other HTML elements

    - class syntax:
        .class_name {
            CSS properties
        }
    - multiple classes
    - different elements can share same class
    - Javascript can access element with a specific class name with the getElementsByClassName() method

id attribute
    - used to specify a unique id for an HTML element
    - cannot have the same id
    - id attribute used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet, also was accessed by Javascript
    - syntax:
        .id_name {
            CSS properties
        }
    - note: id must containt at least one character; cannot start with a number, must not contain whitespaces (spaces, tabs...)

head element:
    - head element is a container for the following elements:
        <title>
        <style>:    define style information for a single HTML page

            - disadvantage: float elements are tied to the document flow, which may harm the flexibility
        + CSS flexbox: used to ensure that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different
            screen size and different display devices.

        + non-semantic elements:    <div>, <span>
        + semantic elements:        <form>, <table>, <article>
    - why semantic: allow data to be shared and reused across application, community
    - some semantic elements:
        + <section>: group of content, where can be used:
            chapter
            introduction
            new item

            newspaper article
        + <header>
            <h1> to <h6>
            logo or icon
            authorship information
        + <footer>
            authorship information
            copyright information
            contact information
            sitemap
            back to top links
            related documents
        + <nav> defines a set of navigation links
        + <aside>: define some content aside from the content it is placed in
        + <figure>, <figcaption>
            <figure>:       self-container content: illustration, diagram, photo, code listing...
            <figcaption>:   define a caption for a <figure> element.

style guide: a consistent, clean and tidy HTML code
    - always declare the document type
    - use lowercase name with:
        element
        attribute
        file name
    - close all HTML elements
    - always quote attribute value
    - always specify the alt, width, height values of a image.
    - less spaces: easier to read
    - avoid long code line
    - 2 spaces instead of tab
    - never skip <title> element
    - always add <html>, <head> and <body>
        recommend using the <head> tag
        omit <body>: can produce error in older browser
        omit <html> and <body> can also cash DOM and XML software
    - close empty element: keep closing slash (/), it's required in XML and XHTML
    - add lang attribute
    - meta data: <meta charset=chatset_name should be defined
    - setting viewport
    - use css and Javascript
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
        <script src="myscript.js">
        access HTML element with Javascript
    - default file name: index.html (when URL does not specify a filename at the end)

entity
    - look like: &entity_name or &#entity_number;
        + entity name: easy to remember
        + disadvantage: browser may not support
    - combine diacritical mark: `,', ~, ^, ?...
